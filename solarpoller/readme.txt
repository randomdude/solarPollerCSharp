A really simple C# project to pull current power use out of a Fronius Datalogger Web (http://www.fronius.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-4392605D-A845710A/fronius_international/hs.xsl/83_16106_ENG_HTML.htm) and return it on the commandline.

Feed it the IP of your datalogger and it will return -1 on failure and 0 on success.

It is super-simple and straightforward.
